"""Single source of truth for the "is it safe to rm -rf this dream worktree?" gate.

Imported by the Python dream lifecycle helpers. Callers pass the candidate
and configured root directly to `safe_worktree_path` before removal.

A path is considered safe to remove ONLY when ALL of these hold:

1. Path and base are both non-empty strings.
2. Path and base are both absolute (start with "/").
3. Neither contains a ".." component in the literal input.
4. The resolved (symlink-followed) base is not a sensitive filesystem root
   (e.g. /, /tmp, /home, $HOME, /Users, /etc, /usr).
5. After resolving symlinks in the path's parent directory, the resolved
   path is STRICTLY INSIDE the resolved base — not equal to it, and not
   above it.
6. The path matches the exact dream-worktree shape `<base>/<ns>/dream-<slug>`
   where `<ns>` and `<slug>` are each `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`.

These rules are deliberately strict: they reject anything that doesn't look
like a dream worktree created by `dream-setup.py`. That means we will NEVER
`rm -rf` a path the user happens to point us at — only paths that match the
namespace's own creation contract.

Standalone diagnostic CLI:
    python3 _worktree_safety.py <worktree-dir> <base> [<ns>]
    exit codes:
      0 → safe AND the path currently exists (caller should rm)
      2 → safe AND the path does NOT exist  (caller should treat as no-op)
      1 → UNSAFE; do not rm                  (error printed to stderr)
