# ShadowFrog — AI Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview

ShadowFrog is a suite of AI coding agent skills that build and maintain shadow knowledge bases for any codebase. It consists of 7 skills (`shadow-frog`, `shadow-frog-init`, `shadow-frog-update`, `shadow-frog-dream`, `shadow-frog-nap`, `shadow-frog-meditate`, `shadow-frog-viewer`) and associated hooks. Nap's proposals remain separate from `.shadow/` discoveries. This is a **distributable skills package** — users install it into their own projects via `install.sh` or `install.ps1`.

## Key Principles

1. **General-purpose** — ShadowFrog works with any codebase, any language. Skills and examples must be language-agnostic. Never assume Python, JS, or any specific stack.

2. **Discoveries, not descriptions** — Shadows contain behavioral insights (edge cases, implicit contracts, non-obvious interactions), NOT code summaries or descriptions. Write "silently returns None on expired tokens" not "handles token expiration".

3. **Two sources of knowledge** — The shadow captures knowledge from autonomous code analysis (`source: exploration`) AND from user-agent conversations (`source: user`, `source: interaction`). User-shared knowledge is the highest-trust source — capture it immediately, anchored to the exact file and symbol.

4. **Symbol-level granularity** — Shadows mirror the codebase at the symbol level, not just file level. Every class, function, and method has a `##` section in its shadow file. This enables precise bidirectional lookup: code→shadow and shadow→code.

5. **Bidirectional references are the core mechanism** — The entire system rests on robust, accurate references between code and shadow. The canonical format is `file::symbol` (e.g., `src/auth.py::UserAuth.validate`). Seven invariants must hold (see `shadow-frog/SKILL.md`). When editing skills, never break reference integrity.

6. **Trust hierarchy** — `source: user` (always verified) > `source: interaction` (always verified) > `verified` exploration > `uncertain` > `refuted`.

7. **Cross-cutting is critical** — `_cross/` discoveries span multiple files and are stored once. Per-file shadows have `## Cross-References` back-pointers. Always maintain both directions.

8. **No backward compatibility** — When refactoring, only keep the latest code. No re-exports, deprecation wrappers, or compatibility shims.

## Important Conventions

### Discovery Format

Canonical formal spec: `/shadow-frog`. The shapes below are the minimum an agent needs to write a valid discovery from claude.md alone.

Per-file discovery (anchored by `file::symbol` heading; labels and `Also involves:` are optional):
```
- <behavioral statement>
  _(<verified|uncertain|refuted>, source: <exploration|user|interaction>[, labels: [bug, security]], citation_score: 0)_
  Also involves: `file::symbol`, `file::symbol`
```

Cross-cutting (`_cross/<slug>.md`, slug = kebab-case from title, e.g. "DB connection lifecycle" → `db-connection-lifecycle.md`):
```
# <Title>

**Category**: <pattern|behavior|edge-case|contract|performance|intent|warning|history|convention>
**Refs**:
- `file::symbol`

**Discovery**: <behavioral statement>

_(<verified|uncertain|refuted>, source: <exploration|user|interaction>, citation_score: 0)_
```

Preference (`_prefs.md` — project-wide, no file/symbol anchor):
```
- <preference or convention>
  _(source: <user|interaction>, citation_score: 0)_
```

- Labels (lowercase, comma-separated): `bug`, `performance`, `security`, `feature-gap`, `tech-debt`. Only for actionable discoveries.
- `Also involves:` always uses `file::symbol`, never bare file paths.
- `Dream report: _dreams/<dream-id>/` is optional — only for experiment-derived discoveries.

### Citation Scores

- Keep one visible nonnegative integer `citation_score` in Markdown metadata,
  after optional labels. New entries start at 0; omitted scores also mean 0.
- Agents read files/symbols directly and explicitly cite consulted entries once
  per task. Use core `shadow-cite.py` for serialized exact-claim increments; no
  database, opaque IDs, or required retrieval service.
- Score updates must not change discovery prose, provenance, references, or counts.
  Coordinate ordinary edits with citation writes; only helper calls share its lock.
- Keep scores when rewording/moving the same claim, and use max rather than sum
  when combining duplicates or inherited branch state. Scores are approximate,
  not a global audited count or a trust/confidence value.

### Verification
- Observe-based: read source at `file::symbol`, trace logic, confirm claim.
- Do-based: write and run a short test/script to confirm or refute.
- `source: user` and `source: interaction` → always `verified`.

### Dedup
- Before writing, read existing discoveries at the target symbol.
- Same claim → update existing. Extends existing → merge. Contradicts → keep both, mark weaker `refuted`.
- If `_No discoveries yet._` placeholder → replace it. If discoveries already exist → append after them.

### Shadow File Headings
- Top-level symbols: `##` heading with symbol in backticks
- Nested symbols: `###` heading with symbol in backticks

Examples:
```
## `authenticate_user`
## `class UserAuth`
### `UserAuth.validate`
```
- `## Cross-References` at the bottom of every per-file shadow

### Cross-Cutting Files (`_cross/<slug>.md`)
- Use `**Refs**:` with `file::symbol` entries
- Category field values: pattern, behavior, edge-case, contract, performance, intent, warning, history, convention

### state.json Schema (canonical)
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "initialized_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "last_update_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "last_commit": "<full 40-char HEAD SHA>",
  "last_update_type": "init|auto|manual|dream|meditate",
  "total_files": 0,
  "total_symbols": 0,
  "total_discoveries": 0,
  "dream_cycles_completed": 0
}
```

`total_discoveries` counts **per-file discoveries only** (excludes `_cross/`
and `_dreams/`). Cross-cutting discoveries are tracked separately via
`ls .shadow/_cross/*.md | wc -l`.

### Dream Reports (`_dreams/`)

Dream experiment reports are archived in `_dreams/` for compounding knowledge
across dream sessions. Each experiment gets a folder named `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSZ-slug`.

Report frontmatter (YAML):
```yaml
---
dream_id: "20250417-183012Z-retry-logic"
category: feature design
verdict: useful | dead_end
base_commit: abc1234def5678
branch: "dream/myproject/20250417-183012Z-retry-logic"
parent_branch: "main"
remote: "origin"
related_symbols:
  - "src/http.py::HttpClient.send"
builds_on: []
---
```

Note: `tip_commit` is NOT stored in the report (chicken-and-egg problem).
The reconciler derives it via `git rev-parse origin/$BRANCH` and records
it in `_dreams/_index.md`.

- `_dreams/_index.md` — table of all experiments (dream_id, category, verdict, title, branch, parent, tip_commit). The `parent` column is a **branch name** (the parent dream's branch, or `main` if rooted at the base branch) — never a dream_id. Both the reconciler (writer) and `dream-lineage.py` (reader) treat it as a branch name; meditate's index repair resolves to and writes the parent row's branch.
- `_dreams/<dream-id>/report.md` — structured report with frontmatter (mirrored from dream branch)
- `_dreams/<dream-id>/patch.diff` — code-only diff against `base_commit` (excludes `.shadow/`)
- `_dreams/<dream-id>/manifest.json` — machine-readable discovery manifest (on dream branch)
- Per-file discoveries cross-reference with `Dream report: _dreams/<dream-id>/`
- `_dreams/` is excluded from discovery counts and viewer file listings

## SKILL.md Format

### Dream/Nap Modes and Proposal Records

- `broad` remains the default. `coherent` regularizes parent-child connections,
  not a whole tree's goal. Children have their own goals; diverse siblings may
  work on the same files. Do not add sibling-similarity or file-disjointness gates.
- The canonical `parent_connection` schema is in `skills/shadow-frog/SKILL.md`
  and checked by `_coherence.py`. Structure is not proof of semantic relevance.
- Dream mode must reach planning, child prompts, artifacts, and the pinned
  validation command. `dream-tools.py` snapshots current helpers/instructions
  outside code repositories and verifies hashes before dispatch; never use a
  historical worktree's installed helpers or manually bypass cleanup checks.
- Cleanup retains coherent branches through canonical index parent edges,
  including repaired/fallback lineage. Unreadable metadata raises an actionable
  error and the CLI exits nonzero before deleting branches.
- Broad exploration uses its initial snapshot; coherent descendants receive
  an orchestrator-refreshed parent ref/tip after the parent is pushed. Siblings
  share that refreshed snapshot, without independent fetches.
- Nap has a version-2 JSON tree with revision, pinned source, limits, nodes,
  append-only review receipts, and selected ready tasks. Managed init/add/review/
  select operations use locking and atomic writes. `@base` is the virtual code
  root; proposals do not require Git branches or implemented parent APIs.
  Its Python helper checks budgets, lineage, source references, and judgments
  bound to exact semantic inputs; it never calls a model or executes probes.
  Its expected mode defaults to broad; coherent runs must pass `--mode coherent`.
  Depth is uncapped by default (`max_depth: null`); explicit user depth limits
  still apply. Node/probe budgets and cycle checks remain mandatory. Probes
  observe existing behavior, while candidate implementations/prototypes belong
  in Dream or downstream work.
- The host provides a strong independent judge in a fresh context. No self-rating
  may impersonate an independent review. `ready` requires a current accepted
  receipt with no blockers; the helper checks association, not model authenticity
  or semantic truth. Revisions append children rather than rewrite parents.
- Nap exports default to a planning dossier; `--audience implementation` is a
  concise handoff with the same required behavior and preserved commitments.
  Optional task `constraints` are binding; `design_suggestions` are not.
  `implementation_risks` may remain after planning approval, while blocking
  `open_questions` may not. Readiness metadata never claims implemented or
  runtime-validated behavior.
- Use concrete progression questions in selected-path review, not a fixed
  tree-wide goal or a quota of steps. Atomic tree publication file-syncs data
  where supported, but does not promise portable power-loss durability.
- Store nap artifacts outside `.shadow/`, or in an initialized
  `.shadow/_meta/naps/`. Never initialize a partial shadow just to store a nap,
  increment dream counters for naps, or treat proposals as verified discoveries.
- Export final active requirements, not superseded ancestor designs or unrelated
  siblings. Idea lineage is separate from actual implementation dependencies.
- New helpers must be cross-platform Python: no Bash/Unix-only dependencies,
  shell-export/eval handoffs, or hard-coded temporary roots. Use native paths,
  explicit UTF-8, argument-list subprocesses, and the shared cleanup safety gate.

### Skill Frontmatter

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: >-
  One-paragraph description. This is what the agent matches
  against to decide when to load the skill.
scripts:        # optional — list script filenames in this directory
  - my-script.py
---

# Skill Title

Markdown instructions for the agent.
```

The `description` field is critical — it determines when the agent auto-loads the skill. Make it specific and action-oriented.

The `scripts` field (optional) lists executable scripts bundled with the skill. Scripts live in the same directory as SKILL.md. With a project install, agents can find them via:
```bash
python3 .github/skills/<skill-name>/<script>.py
# or, for Claude Code:
python3 .claude/skills/<skill-name>/<script>.py
```

## Hook Format

Two agent platforms, two hook-config shapes, **one set of shared scripts**:

**Copilot CLI** — `hook-templates/shadow-frog-hooks.json` (installed to
`.github/hooks/hooks.json`):
- `sessionStart` / `preToolUse` events; handler uses `bash:` + `timeoutSec`
- Reads context from the top-level `additionalContext` output key. For
  `preToolUse`, support for `additionalContext` is undocumented in the 2026
  hooks reference but explicitly confirmed in the copilot-cli v1.0.24
  changelog. If Copilot ever removes this, the `sessionStart` reminder
  remains; only the pre-edit injection silently no-ops.

**Claude Code** — `hook-templates/claude-settings.json` (merged into
`.claude/settings.json`):
- `SessionStart` / `PreToolUse` events (PascalCase), matcher-group nesting,
  `command:` + `timeout`, scripts referenced via `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`
- Reads context from the nested `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` key

**Shared script contract** (both `check-init.sh` and `pre-tool.sh`):
- Receive JSON on stdin; parse both camelCase (Copilot `toolName`/`toolInput`)
  and snake_case (Claude `tool_name`/`tool_input`) field names
- Emit JSON carrying BOTH output shapes so one payload drives both agents
- Use `python3 -c "import json,sys; ..."` for JSON parsing (not grep/cut)
- Keep hooks fast (< 5 second timeout)
- **Fail-open — the hooks are advisory and MUST always exit 0.** Copilot CLI
  ≥ 1.0.57 denies the tool call when a `preToolUse` command hook exits
  non-zero. The scripts therefore use a **multi-layer defense** (interactive
  scripts like `install.sh` and `dream-setup.py` are the opposite — they
  fail-fast):

  1. **No `set -e`/`-u`/`pipefail`** — failing sub-steps don't abort the script.
  2. **Trap pyramid** — separate `trap 'exit 0' EXIT` AND
     `trap 'exit 0' TERM HUP INT`. EXIT alone returns 143/-15 under SIGTERM
     (empirically verified on bash 3.2 macOS / bash 5+ Linux), which the
     runner's `timeoutSec` enforcement triggers; the TERM trap converts it to 0.
  3. **Every external call bounded** — `git`, `python3`, and viewer
     subprocesses MUST run inside Python `subprocess.run(timeout=...)`
     wrappers. Bash queues signals while waiting for a foreground child, so
     the trap pyramid cannot save us from an unbounded hang. Total bounded
     work budget is ~3.5s, leaving ≥1.5s headroom under the hook's 5s
     `timeoutSec`. The previously-unbounded `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
     in pre-tool.sh was reproduced as a 31s hang in production.
  4. **`state.json` read inside Python** (`json.load(open(...))`) rather than
     a shell `< redirect`, so a missing file is a caught exception instead of
     an stderr leak.
  5. **Static enforcement** — `hook-templates/check-hook-failopen.py` blocks changes
     that re-introduce any of: short/long-form strict-mode flags, `source`/`.`
     of external files, missing EXIT or TERM trap,
     comment-masquerading-as-trap, or unbounded `git` calls at bash level.

## Development

- SKILL.md files ARE the product — edit them directly
- Test by running skills in Copilot CLI / Claude Code
- Hook scripts are bash with python3 for JSON — keep them simple and fast
- Use `install.sh --project <repo>` (with `--agent copilot|claude`) to copy
  skills, hooks, and context into a project repo
- The `examples/coupon-demo/.shadow/` must stay consistent with skill docs (same formats, same field names, matching counts)
- After any format change, audit ALL files for consistency (skills, examples, hooks, README, claude.md)
